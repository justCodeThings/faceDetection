# Python Face Detection in OpenCV

This is a face detection app that will find your stupid face, slap a circle on it, print the coordinates of your cranium to the console, and the spit out a video once you quit so you can cherish your hideous features being pointed out in low resolution.  Please enjoy.

### Prerequisites

The Face Detection App has been tested in **Python 3x**.  You will need to have the `opencv-python`, `face_recognition`, and `pyautogui` modules preinstalled. All these modules can be installed with pip.  If you don't want to use pyautogui for any reason,  it can be ommitted.  See the code for directions.

### Using the App

To use the Face detection App,
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the program
3. Follow the prompts

It's not rocket science.  Should run smoothly as long as all the modules are installed and updated.
